# ✍ Study
## The Subject Of Data Structures And Algorithms - 408
**Happy Summer Holiday!** I had arrived home on the 4th and started to review this subject after two days formally. Unfortunately, it's regret that I didn't have enough time to revise all the knowledge in the month-end, there has some reason as shown below for it :

1. Realize some algorithms about the graph with code, such as `BFS`, `DFS`, `Prim`, `Kruskal`, `Dijkstra`, `Floyd`, and `TopologicalSorting` Algorithm

2. Realize some algorithms about the sort with code, such as `StraightInsertionSort`, `BinaryInsertionSort`, `ShellSort`, `BubbleSort`, `QuickSort`, `SimpleSectionSort`, `HeapSort`, `MergeSort`, and `RadixSort` Algorithm

3. Realize some algorithms about the tree with code, such as `PreorderTraversal`, `InorderTraversal`, `PostorderTraversal`, and `LevelOrderTraversal` Algorithm

4. Draw the knowledge mindmap

But the final learn quality isn't satisfactory to me because I wouldn't like to finish the practice question after learning the new knowledge and **blindly pursue the learning speed.**

## The Subject Of Operating System - 408
Just learns one chapter.

## Two Thousand English Words
This task only finished half, So what's the reason for it. Yes, you guess right, that's **procrastination.**


# 💪 Work out
The total time of working out is **603** minutes, consumed **4968** calories. The primary data of working out is as shown below :

1. the sum of running distance is **19.41** kilometers
2. there had twenty-five days which the exercise time was less than **30** min

So terrible what I did this month, and this data is the lowest than the previous six months. The main reason is that I need time to adapt to the new environment, moreover **hadn't taken enough time to sleep.**


# 😴 Rest
The rest plan is to wake up at **5:30** am and go to sleep at **22:30** in the nighttime, but concrete daily data didn't record due to the **procrastination.** In this month, I often watch some short videos on my mobile phone all night so that the learning status is bad all daytime. That seems like a loop cycle and became a habit finally. That's why the learning efficiency is so low in daily life.


# 💲 Consumption
The excess consumption is **219￥** and other data is private.


# 💬 Comment
1. Not pursue the learning speed but more effectiveness
2. Make the best of the daytime and keep early hours
3. Get out procrastination


> 😔 **By the way, there had a few days I feel anxious all day because my resume fell on deaf ears.**
